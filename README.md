# Oscilloscope using Arduino and Processing

### Description

Sampling oscilloscope with 2 channels (voltages from 0 to 5V), with frequencies up to 3kHz.

Simplified, translated and (hopefully) improved version of [rogeriobego/oscilloscope-arduino-processing](https://github.com/rogeriobego/oscilloscope-arduino-processing)

The programming language "Processing"  was used (www.processing.org) to create the program on the computer.
